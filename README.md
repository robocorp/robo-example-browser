# robo-example-browser

This repository is the `browser` template of [robo](https://github.com/robocorp/robo) with generated configuration files.

It shows what the [rcc](https://github.com/robocorp/rcc)-compatible files `conda.yaml` and `robot.yaml` look like, and it can be used directly in Control Room.
